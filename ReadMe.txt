Node-centric ovErlapping Community deTection AlgoRithm

This repository contains implementations of the NECTAR algorithm as described in: TODO.
As well as tools we used such as Omega-Index.

Under 'V1' u can find two java implemented version to the NECTAR algorithm.
Under 'Tools' you can find our implementation to the Omega-Index calculating tool. 
'V2' is the version similar to 'V1', except that the objective function is chosen by the algorithm.
